title: About Me
---
  I'm an undergrad studying Bioengineering @ <a href="https://www.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">UC Berkeley</a> with a focus in <b>mixed signal circuit design</b>, <b>acoustics</b>, and in general, <b>technology interfacing the human body and brain.</b><br><br>
  On campus, you can either find me doing research @ <a href="https://linlab.me.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Lin Lab</a> or @ <a href="https://www.rikkymuller.com/" target="_blank">Muller Lab</a>, running around making devices for <a href="https://neurotech.studentorg.berkeley.edu/" target="_blank">Neurotech@Berkeley</a> or at one of the 20 libraries at Berkeley studying it up :D.

  As part of <a href="https://linlab.me.berkeley.edu/">Liwei Lin Lab</a> and with the support from the <a href="https://research.berkeley.edu/hsp-scholars/sean-isomatsu/">Haas Scholars Program</a> I was an integral part of the validation of a novel, high pressure, micromachined ultrasound array for stimulation of the brain. Previously, I worked on 3D-printed bone phantoms as well, co-authoring an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=KZ48Jh8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=KZ48Jh8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer>IEEE MEMS conference paper</a> on bone-age detection using a micromachined ultrasound array.<br><br>
  I recently joined <a href="https://www.rikkymuller.com/">Rikky Muller Lab</a> where I will be working on developing new algorithms for ultrasound phase abberation corrections of the skull, and confirmation of ultrasound focal point inside the brain without the use of CT or MRI scans. <br><br>
  I am currently the Devices Lead at <a href="https://neurotech.studentorg.berkeley.edu/">Neurotech@Berkeley</a>, a student organization here at Cal. In this club, we build <b>Analog Front-End(s)</b> for biosignal aquisiton, <b>sensory substitution</b> devices, and <b>ultrasound phased array</b> demos! We are a group of ~150 undergraduates and graduate students and we give and listen to talks, build cool stuff, and share out passion for neurotechnology!<br><br>
