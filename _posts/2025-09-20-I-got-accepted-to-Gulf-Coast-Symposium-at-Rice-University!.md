I got accepted to the Electrical and Computer Engineering section of the Gulf Coast Undergraduate Research Symposium hosted by RICE University. I will be doing an oral presentation of October 18, 2025 on "Transcranial Focused Ultrasound through the Temporal Bone via Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasound Transducers".
