  I'm a fourth year bioengineering undergrad at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"> University of California, Berkeley</a> with a strong interest in the intersection of mixed signal circuit design, sound, and the human body and brain.
  As part of <a href="https://linlab.me.berkeley.edu/">Liwei Lin Lab</a> and with the support from the <a href="https://research.berkeley.edu/hsp-scholars/sean-isomatsu/">Haas Scholars Program</a> I was an integral part of the validation of a novel, high pressure, micromachined ultrasound array for stimulation of the brain. Previously, I worked on 3D-printed bone phantoms as well, co-authoring a <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=KZ48Jh8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=KZ48Jh8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C">conference paper</a> on bone-age detection using a micromachined ultrasound array.
  I am currently the Devices Lead at <a href="https://neurotech.studentorg.berkeley.edu/">Neurotech@Berkeley</a>, a student organization here at Cal. In this club, we build Analog Front-End(s) for biosignal aquisiton, sensory substitution devices, and ultrasound phased array demos! We are a group of ~150 undergraduates and graduate students and we give and listen to talks, build cool stuff, and share out passion for neurotechnology!
  I recently joined <a href="https://www.rikkymuller.com/">Rikky Muller Lab</a> where I will be working on developing new algorithms for ultrasound phase abberation corrections of the skull, and confirmation of ultrasound focal point inside the brain without the use of CT or MRI scans.
