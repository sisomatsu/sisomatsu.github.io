  I'm a bioengineering undergraduate at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/University_of_California,_Berkeley"> UCB</a> specializing in <b>mixed signal circuit design</b>, <b>sound</b>, and the <b>human body</b> and <b>brain</b>.<br><br>
  As part of <a href="https://linlab.me.berkeley.edu/">Liwei Lin Lab</a> and with the support from the <a href="https://research.berkeley.edu/hsp-scholars/sean-isomatsu/">Haas Scholars Program</a> I was an integral part of the validation of a novel, high pressure, micromachined ultrasound array for stimulation of the brain. Previously, I worked on 3D-printed bone phantoms as well, co-authoring an <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=view_citation&hl=en&user=KZ48Jh8AAAAJ&citation_for_view=KZ48Jh8AAAAJ:u5HHmVD_uO8C">IEEE MEMS conference paper</a> on bone-age detection using a micromachined ultrasound array.<br><br>
  I recently joined <a href="https://www.rikkymuller.com/">Rikky Muller Lab</a> where I will be working on developing new algorithms for ultrasound phase abberation corrections of the skull, and confirmation of ultrasound focal point inside the brain without the use of CT or MRI scans. <br><br>
  I am currently the Devices Lead at <a href="https://neurotech.studentorg.berkeley.edu/">Neurotech@Berkeley</a>, a student organization here at Cal. In this club, we build <b>Analog Front-End(s)</b> for biosignal aquisiton, <b>sensory substitution</b> devices, and <b>ultrasound phased array</b> demos! We are a group of ~150 undergraduates and graduate students and we give and listen to talks, build cool stuff, and share out passion for neurotechnology!<br><br>
