I am now part of the <a href="https://www.rikkymuller.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer>Rikky Muller Lab</a> in the Department of Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at UC Berkeley.<br><br>
I will be working on an algorithm to correct for the skin, skull, and brain in transcranial focused ultrasound without the use of CT or MRI.
